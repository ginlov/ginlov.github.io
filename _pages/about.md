I am a Computer Science Master’s student at **UC San Diego**. My **intended** research focus is on **motion planning**, specifically bridging foundation models with control theory for safety-guaranteed autonomous behavior. At UCSD, I work with [Professor Ravi Ramamoorthi](https://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~ravir/) on 3D reconstruction and novel view synthesis. Previously, I conducted undergraduate research under the supervision of [Professor Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) on diffusion models for image generation and ML theory regarding the generalization capabilities of deep neural networks. I bring industry experience from an ADAS internship at **Woven by Toyota** and AI roles at **TopCV**, **Viettel Group** and **Techcom Securities**.

**Research Interests:** VLA Models, and Reinforcement Learning([work sample](/projects/2_project))
 for Motion Planning.
