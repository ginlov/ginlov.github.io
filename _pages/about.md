I am a Master's student in Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Before moving to the US, I gained experience in various AI-related roles at [Techcom Securities](https://www.tcbs.com.vn/home), [Viettel Group](https://viettel.com.vn/en/) and [TopCV Vietnam](https://topcv.vn). I previously conducted research under the supervision of Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) at [DSLab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn). More recently, I worked on a 3D reconstruction project in [Professor Ravi's group](https://viscomp.ucsd.edu), with a focus on novel view synthesis using diffusion models. My interests lie in computer vision, 3D perception, and robotic planning, and Iâ€™m always open to discussion and collaboration.
