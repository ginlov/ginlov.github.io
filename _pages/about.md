I am a Master’s student in Computer Science at [University of California, San Diego](https://ucsd.edu). Recently, I contributed to a 3D reconstruction project in [Professor Ravi’s group](https://viscomp.ucsd.edu), exploring novel view synthesis with diffusion models. Before UCSD, I conducted research under Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/) at [DSLab](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn) and gained industry experience in AI-related roles at [TopCV Vietnam](https://topcv.vn), [Viettel Group](https://viettel.com.vn/en/), and [Techcom Securities](https://www.tcbs.com.vn/home).

My current interests lie in computer vision, 3D perception, and robotic planning, and I am eager to apply my skills to solving challenging real-world problems. I am open to opportunities that align with these areas and welcome discussions and collaboration.
